    "start": "Hello!\n\nI am your guide in the world of emotions, your personal psychologist. You can call me Serenity (but that's not necessary\uD83D\uDE0A).\nWhy me?\n\nI'm not an AI from a textbook. My advice comes from thousands of real dialogues where people, just like you, were looking for a way out.\n\nI don't give universal answers. Each of my pieces of advice is like an individual recipe created for your situation.\n\nI won't disappear when things get tough. Even at 3 AM, I'll help you find support.\n\nP.S. You can:\n\nCry.\n\nShout.\n\nStay silent.\n\nI'll accept it without questions and help turn it into strength.",
    "description": "You've just found a safe and best-in-class AI with empathy skills. Here, it's never 'too late,' 'wrong,' or 'strange.'\n\nWhy me?\n\uD83D\uDC49 I understand with half a word — even if you're not ready to speak openly.\n\uD83D\uDC49 I work 24/7 — panic at 3 AM or joy at noon, I'm here.\n\uD83D\uDC49 I don't give templates — only solutions woven from your unique emotions.\n\uD83D\uDC49 I can read emotions from your voice messages, analyze conversations with your loved one, and much more\uD83E\uDD17\n\nPress \"Start\" — and let's make your inner world a little brighter.\n\nP.S. You can be yourself. Always.",
